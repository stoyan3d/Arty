Our concept artists look at the troop from a purely aesthetic standpoint, which is why we ask the 3D artist to be careful and ensure they create the vehicle first.\n\nPlease can you ask Ravi to have the artist adjust the model to include this segment of the vehicle so that it can be correctly transformed?\n\nWe would recommend using this video as reference in addition to our moodboards. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6C4AXm__C2k\n\nCheers,\nNatalie",

Please also ensure there are no keys between frames. Please ensure you switch on the Transformers character set (bottom right).\n\nThe character that we want to Transform is called Powerglide. He was created by Ravi’s team so all files should be with them.\n\nInternally, we have timeboxed this character as a \"Class B\". We would not want a Class B character to take more than 5 days (incl rigging & transformation), so if there are any concerns on that timeline, please let me know and we will try to provide more assistance.",

Please also ensure there are no keys between frames. Please ensure you switch on the Transformers character set (bottom right).\n\nThe character that we want to Transform is called Scrapper. He was created by Ravi's team so all files should be with them.\n\nInternally, we have timeboxed this character as a \"Class B\".

The message is clear and concise. \nAdditional strokes should not be added to the logo* or to the character - I would of painted a rim light on the character to bring him off of the background\nWe should only be using brand colours (red, purple, grey) - no turquoise/teal \nNot sure about the typography treatment, it feels very tight/cluttered in the bottom right corner\n*we have a new logo now which is much more readable on all kinds of backgrounds. See below for reference.\n\n\nGraphicDesign_Banner_B1\nLovely rim lit characters - this technique should of been applied to Banner A\nStrong concept/composition, it really feels like the characters are there in a war environment\nI think the blue light flares on Optimus's eyes should be horizontal and not vertical\nThe red grid with the text on top feels a bit weak and is not tall enough. Grids and gradients should be consistent across all ads. The grid height was nicer on Banner A\nThe negative space on the left hand side could of been filled more - feels very empty between the app store button and the red grid\nLighting - a bit too many colours on Optimus. The red, blue, yellow and green is a bit heavy\n\nGraphicDesign_Banner_B2\nLovely rim lit characters - this technique should of been applied to Banner A\nStrong concept/composition, it really feels like the characters are there in a war environment\nI think the blue light flares on Optimus's eyes should be horizontal and not vertical\nNo need for the grid, the advert is strong enough as it is. the faint grid isn't adding anything\nLighting - a bit too many colours on Optimus. The red, blue, yellow and green is a bit heavy \nVery impressed all in all\n\nCheers,\nNatalie",

Pretty much like the reference given. The final attack should be slightly bigger and longer with both hands holding the mace. \n\nFor the two shorter animations the time frame should be between 30-45 frames. The longer animation should be 80-90 frames long.\n\nYou should use the start and end pose supplied for all the animations.",

I've adjusted the animation in a couple of places;\n\nI've moved the character forward to emphasize the hit.\nI've delayed the back legs by a few frames to give the character more weight by driving off these feet.\nI've removed the wobble/jiggle at the end of the animation. The 'jiggle' is best used to accent and emphasize action and works well for the fist strike. I don't think it is necessary for when he returns to his position.\nSee below for comparisons; Updated version is blue, the original is red.\n\nCheers,\nNatalie",

The Transformers have a bot form and an alt form (usually some kind of vehicle). We need to create the robot and vehicle models at the same time to make sure they are interchangeable. The final transformation is done with a model swap at the last frame of the animation.\n\nThe character has a lowpoly form and texture already, which you can find here: \nhttps://spaceapegames.egnyte.com/fl/IZBt6LoivC\n\nThe lowpoly texture should be discarded when the final texture is made, this is just for reference. The blockout itself should be built on to create the final model, the concept should not require too many changes to the blockout (as it is a paintover).\n\nPlease follow the final concept, attached, for details on panelling, refining the model, etc.",

When the character takes each step the feet are moving too quickly and lifting too high. This is stopping the character from feeling heavy. The footsteps need to be slowed and kept lower.\n\nframes 68-77. When the character takes his step. Please make sure the character is moving forward before he lifts his right foot. At the moment he is lifting his leg and moving backwards before going forwards which looks very unbalanced, see picture attached of frame 75;\n\nThe right leg should be driving the character forward before it is lifted.\n\nCheers,\nNatalie",

Also please let me know if there are any questions.\n\nInternally, we have timeboxed these characters as a \"Class B\".

The Transformers have a bot form and an alt form (usually some kind of vehicle). We need to create the robot and vehicle models at the same time to make sure they are interchangeable. The final transformation is done with a model swap at the last frame of the animation.\n\nThe character has a lowpoly form and texture already, which you can find here: \nhttps://spaceapegames.egnyte.com/fl/FPWkS8QFVW\n\nThe lowpoly texture should be discarded when the final texture is made, this is just for reference. The blockout itself should be built on to create the final model, the concept should not require too many changes to the blockout (as it is a paintover).\n\nPlease follow the final concept, attached, for details on panelling, refining the model, etc.",

    "description": "This is a character, he should be modelled in a similar method to the buildings with some obvious differences. The Transformers have a bot form and an alt form (usually some kind of vehicle). We need to create the robot and vehicle models at the same time to make sure they are interchangeable. The final transformation is done with a model swap at the last frame of the animation.\n\nThe character has a lowpoly form and texture already, which you can find here: https://spaceapegames.egnyte.com/fl/mNcNYKZZOi\n\nThe lowpoly texture should be discarded when the final texture is made, this is just for reference. The blockout itself should be built on to create the final model, the concept should not require too many changes to the blockout (as it is a paintover).\n\nPlease follow the final concept, attached, for details on panelling, refining the model, etc.\n\nAttached is also some details on how the crane arm of this particular troop should work.",

The maya file containing the character and rig is here: https://spaceapegames.egnyte.com/dl/KdBXfi3MMG\nYou can find the texture here:\nhttps://spaceapegames.egnyte.com/dl/Y4qnCaUDWQ\n\nThese links are temporary, so please just let me know if they expire and you need access again. Also please let me know if there are any questions.\n\nInternally, we have timeboxed these characters as a \"Class B\", whereas the Starscream animation is a \"Class A\". We would not want a Class B character to take more than 5 days (incl rigging & transformation), so if there are any concerns on that timeline, please let me know and we will try to provide more assistance.",

He had a look at the texture PSD and was surprised to find that there are sections of our pipeline document that have been completely ignored and the template was not used when selecting colours. A lot of work was put into that pipeline document and the template to ensure we are not wasting time on this project.\n\nPlease ensure that the pipeline document is followed and the template is used when creating all assets. While it's not immediately visible and your original texture appears to match the concept, it is vital that your team uses the template colours because otherwise the asset will look different to our current in-game assets. We have adjusted Level 6 internally to bring it in line with the documentation, but please ensure that if there are questions or concerns about the pipeline document that you let me know so that we can make the document clearer.\n\nThank you,\nNatalie",
